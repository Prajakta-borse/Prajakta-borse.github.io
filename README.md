Data Visualization scripts and plots
Data Sources: (Public data) Human development indices on the UNDP website.
Observations:
1. Bar plot:
The data is discrete and not continuous. So we choose the bar plot. We can observe that the country Angola has the highest % of renewable energy from total energy. While Algeria has the lowest, which is almost close to zero.
2. Scatter Plot:
To observe the correlation between HDI and Gender ratio values. Form the scatter plot we can observe that the correlation between HDI values and Gender ratio is positive but low. Almost close to zero.
3. Histogram:
To observe the distribution of HDI values.
It can be observed that between HDI values of 0.7 and 0.8, the frequency is highest. This means that frequency is highest for countries with HDI index lying between 0.7 and 0.8.
4. Stacked bar plot: Using Stacked bar plot we are able to compare the Percent Renewable Energy values from total energy for two years- 2015 and 2016 simultaneously. We could also add the values for more years and get differences in the values for different years. 
5. Horizontal Bar plot:
The horizontal bar plot is useful when there are many labels, which cannot be fit in the vertical bar plot. In horizontal bar plot we compared the values for 20 countries simultaneously.
